    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>An apple pie is a fruit pie in which the principal filling ingredient is apples. Apple pie is often served with
        whipped cream, ice cream ("apple pie à la mode"), custard or cheddar cheese.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 recipe for double pie crust</li>
        <li>2 1/4 lbs Granny Smith Apples, peeled, cored 6-7 apples (7 cups thinly sliced)</li>
        <li>1 1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
        <li>3 Tbsp all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/4 cup water</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 egg , + 1 Tbsp water, for egg wash</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Make the pie crust recipe and chill per instructions while preparing the filling. Preheat oven to 425˚F.
        </li>
        <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in 3 Tbsp flour then simmer for 1 minute, whisking
            constantly. </li>
        <li>Whisk in 1/4 cup water, 1 cup sugar and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and continue simmering 3 minutes,
            whisking frequently then remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Peel, remove cores and thinly slice 7 cups of apples and place them in a large bowl. </li>
        <li>Sprinkle the top with 1 1/2 tsp cinnamon and toss to combine.</li>
        <li>Pour the sauce over the apples and stir to coat the apple slices.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle your work surface with flour and roll out bottom pie crust to a 12" diameter circle.</li>
        <li>Wrap it around your rolling pin to transfer it to the 9" pie plate.</li>
        <li>Add apple mixture, mounding slightly in the center and being careful not to get the filling on the edges
            which would make it difficult to seal.</li>
        <li>Roll second crust into an 11" round and cut into 10 even thickness strips using a pizza cutter.</li>
        <li>Arrange strips in a woven lattice pattern over the top (see video tutorial). Beat together 1 egg and 1 Tbsp
            water and brush the top with egg mixture.</li>
        <li>Bake at 425˚F in the center of the oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350˚F and continue baking another
            45 minutes or until apples are soft and filling is bubbling through the vents.* Rest at room temp 1 hour
            before serving.</li>
    </ol>
