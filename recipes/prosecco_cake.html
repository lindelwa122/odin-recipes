    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Prosecco cake is a delightful and indulgent dessert that combines the light and bubbly characteristics of
        prosecco wine with the sweetness of cake. Typically, it's a moist and airy sponge cake infused with the flavor
        of prosecco and often accompanied by a prosecco-infused frosting or glaze. The cake's flavor profile is a
        balance between the fruity and floral notes of the sparkling wine and the sweetness of the cake itself. It's a
        popular choice for celebrations and special occasions, offering a unique twist on traditional cake flavors. The
        cake can be decorated with various toppings such as fresh berries, edible flowers, or even a dusting of powdered
        sugar. It's a perfect treat for those who enjoy the effervescence of prosecco and want to experience its flavors
        in a different culinary form.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>350g unsalted butter, plus a little for the tins</li>
        <li>350g golden caster sugar</li>
        <li>6 eggs</li>
        <li>350g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>100ml prosecco</li>
        <li>100g raspberry jam</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3</li>
        <li>Butter the inside of 2 deep, loose bottomed 21cm tins. </li>
        <li>Cream the butter and sugar together with electric beaters until it is light and fluffy, then gradually beat
            in the eggs a little at a time.</li>
        <li>Fold in the flour and a pinch of salt, don't worry if the mixture look like it has split, it will come back
            together when the flour is added. Pour in the Prosecco and stir until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Spoon the mixture into the tins, level the top and bake for 45-50 mins or until the cakes are well-risen and
            golden and a skewer inserted comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 10 minutes and then turn them out
            onto a rack.</li>
        <li>While the cakes cool, make the icing. Beat the butter with the icing sugar until it is smooth. Add the
            Prosecco and beat again until the frosting is fluffy and smooth.</li>
        <li>Level the cakes if you need to and spread the raspberry jam on one of the cakes followed by some of the
            butter cream, sandwich the other cake on top. </li>
        <li>Roughly ice the cake all over in a very thin layer with a couple of tablespoons of buttercream, this will
            help all the crumbs stick to the cake and help make the outer layer of icing nice and clean. Ice the cake
            all over with the remaining buttercream, this can be quite rough because you are going to stick sweet all
            over it</li>
        <li>Now stick sweets all over it. Go mad. Drink Prosecco with it.
        </li>
    </ol>
